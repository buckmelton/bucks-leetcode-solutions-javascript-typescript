Leetcode 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10**4].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }

/*
 BUCK'S NOTES:
 The Max Depth is found by doing a recursive DFS (Depth First Search) on the Binary Tree.
 Unfortunately, every node must be visited.
 A scope variable will be needed to track the maximum depth encountered so far.
